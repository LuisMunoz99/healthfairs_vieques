**`Project`**: [Revitalizing Vieques – Empowering Healthcare through HMARIA/ACS’s Operation Giving Back Puerto Rico](conference_abstract_1.pdf)](link)

**`Project`**: [Student Coordinated Specialty Health Fair Program for the Underserved Municipality of Vieques, Puerto Rico](conference_abstract_1.pdf)](link)

This repository compiles the documentation, code, and resources for free services health fairs developed in Vieques, Puerto Rico. Each project is presented through a separate conference abstract. Vieques is a  municipality off the eastern coast of Puerto Rico. With a population of around 8,000, the island faces healthcare challenges, including a lack of a functional hospital and limited access to medical services and equipment. Geographic isolation compounds these issues, requiring residents to take inconsistent ferry trips to the mainland for medical appointments. 

## Objectives
1. **Access to healthcare**: Organize Specialty Health Fairs to address the healthcare needs of Vieques's residents, reducing the gap in access to specialist healthcare services.
2. **Student Involvement**: Engage medical students, residents, and physicians in volunteer work within rural community-based settings to enhance healthcare outcomes and promote the well-being of Vieques residents.
3. **Develop Alliances**: Foster collaboration with local organizations, NGOs, corporations, and medical schools to provide access to specialty healthcare services.

## Structure
- **`/abstracts`**: Stores the conference abstracts for both projects.
- **`/docs`**: Documentation related to methodologies and project outcomes.
- **`/presentations`**: Includes slide decks and presentation materials from the conferences.
